LiteFixtures
=============

INSTALL: 
  script/plugin install git://github.com/theIntuitionist/lite-fixtures.git

Lite Fixtures introduces two syntactical improvements to standard rails fixtures.  

  1) Patterns in fixture names
    Using the pattern "(owners)s_(color)_(make)" in conjunction with the fixture 
    name "Freds_red_Ford" unpacks owner to Fred, color to red and make to Ford.  
    
    So:

      (owners)s_(color)_(make)

        Freds_red_Ford:
          year: 1977
          
        Eds_blue_Chevy:
          year: 1987
      
        
    Becomes
    
        Freds_red_Ford:
          owner: Fred
          color: red
          make:  Ford
          year:  1977

        Eds_blue_Chevy:
          owner: Ed
          color: blue
          make:  Chevy
          year: 1987
          
    2) Grouping of Data
      Often fixtures group cleanly- family of users, manufacturers of cars, etc.  Lite fixtures lets you nest data, so scoped values are propigated inward. 

    So:
    
      red_fords:
        make: ford
        color: red

        mustang:
          owner: freddy

        taurus:
          owner: freddy
          
    Becomes:
    
      mustang:
        make: ford
        color: red
        owner: freddy

      taurus:
        make: ford
        color: red
        owner: freddy
    

All the usual fixture features are still supported
